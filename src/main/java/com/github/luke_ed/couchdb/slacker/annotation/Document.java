 * Annotation to specify a document context (name of database). Annotation must be present for all entities. This annotation designated if standard access
 * (i.e. one entity per database) or view access is used. View access is based on an idea, that there are more entities in one database (e.g. database animal
 * contains dog, cat, birds and etc.). The other assumption is that every entity has kind of compound key made from _id and another field
 * which name is set by {@link #typeField()}, it means value of the field is condition used in mapping function of view which is used as access to entities of
 * the same type. More information visit https://github.com/Majlanky/couch-slacker/wiki/CouchDB-layout-with-Couch-Slacker
